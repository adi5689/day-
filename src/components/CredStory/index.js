           So, Us meeting was kind of accidental or predestined you caan say, as we used to be in the same branch, in the same class but we didn't know the other person.
           But us going on that trip, us connecting.....It's all kind of happened so fast...after that anyone can say the rest is history.
           We are like a power couple, who stand by each other and it seems like nothing can break them. It may seem so effortless to the spectators.

            But the truth is, we have been through lows and highs in our journey,had many hurdles but what made us powerful was we sticked to each other, which I&apos;m really proud of.
            Honestly, I didn&apos;t think we will come this far in the beginning but now that we&apos;re here, I really enjoyed the journey and want to share the same in the future with you.
            So proud of how you have grown as a lady and als how you made me a better man. And honestly if I&apos;ll say, you&apos;re you&apos;re <strong>&apos;Monica&apos;</strong> to my <strong>&apos;Chandler&apos;</strong>, my <strong>&apos;Happy Place&apos;</strong>, my <strong>&apos;Sukoon&apos;</strong>, my <strong>&apos;Home&apos;</strong>.
